ROLE: IMPLEMENTER
MODE: Electron + React (NO React Router)
MISSION: Implement browser-like Back/Forward navigation using an internal navigation stack

CONTEXT
The app does not use react-router.
Navigation is currently implicit, causing:
- No reliable Back/Forward
- Lost list context
- User trapped after following links

GOAL
Provide deterministic Back / Forward behavior like a browser.

REQUIREMENTS

A) NAVIGATION STACK
Implement a global NavigationStore with:
- past: View[]
- current: View
- future: View[]

Expose actions:
- navigateTo(view)
- goBack()
- goForward()

Rules:
- navigateTo:
  - push current → past
  - clear future
- goBack:
  - pop from past → current
  - push old current → future
- goForward:
  - pop from future → current
  - push old current → past

B) VIEW DEFINITION
Views must include enough state to restore UI:
- Organize: filters, date range, read/unread, scroll/page
- ReviewDetail: messageId + from Organize snapshot

C) UI
- Add Back / Forward buttons in app header
- Disable when no past/future
- Keyboard:
  - Alt+Left → Back
  - Alt+Right → Forward

D) LINK SAFETY
Navigation stack must NOT be affected by:
- External links
- Invoice downloads
Those must not call navigateTo.

E) DEFINITION OF DONE
- Back returns to exact previous view + state
- Forward works symmetrically
- No accidental navigation replaces app UI
- No dependency on react-router introduced
- Build passes

OUTPUT
Unified diff patch only.
