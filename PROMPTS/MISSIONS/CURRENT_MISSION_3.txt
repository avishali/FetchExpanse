ROLE: IMPLEMENTER
TASK: FIX regression in scan pipeline caused by accidental deletion of SQL INSERT statement.

CONTEXT
Phase 2.5 implementation introduced a regression in src/pipeline/steps.ts:
- The SQL statement used to insert into messages is missing the leading
  “INSERT INTO messages (” line.
- This causes scan to crash with:
  SqliteError: near "gmail_message_id": syntax error

GOAL
Restore the missing SQL line and ensure scan runs correctly again.

FILES TO MODIFY (ONLY)
- src/pipeline/steps.ts

REQUIREMENTS
1) Restore the SQL statement so it is syntactically correct:
   - Must begin with:
     INSERT INTO messages (
   - Followed by the existing column list and VALUES clause.
2) Do not modify column order or semantics.
3) Do not change link capture logic, schema, or UI.
4) Keep changes minimal and localized.

DEFINITION OF DONE
- npm run build passes
- npm run expense -- scan (mock or real) no longer crashes
- No other files modified

OUTPUT FORMAT
Single unified diff patch (git patch).
No extra commentary.
